# Predictive Text Models Demo

This project demonstrates the capabilities of predictive text models through a simple web application. It includes two models: one trained on hotel reviews to predict text based on user input, and another model that explores textual analysis of a classic piece of literature in the detective genre.

## Project Structure

- `predictive_models_demo.html`: The main HTML file for the demo application.
- `app.py`: A Flask application that serves the predictive model's functionality over a simple API.
- `PredictiveTextModel.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the training process, dataset preparation, and model architecture.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the web application.
- `b.csv`: Dataset file containing hotel reviews (used for training Model 1).
- Literature excerpts (used for training Model 2) are discussed within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- **Model 1**: Generates predictive text based on hotel reviews.
- **Model 2**: Analyzes text from a piece of classic detective literature.
- Web interface for real-time interaction with the models.
- Insights into data preparation, model training, and potential applications.
